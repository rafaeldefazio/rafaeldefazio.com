If you have a social or nonprofit project, consider applying for programs like [DigitalOcean's Hub For Good](https://www.digitalocean.com/hub-for-good)! 🌟

During the pandemic, DigitalOcean generously granted the PICOVID project more than $1,000 worth of cloud credits through the Hub For Good Program. THANK YOU! 🙏 This support was instrumental in keeping our project alive and making a real difference.

**What is PICOVID?**

PICOVID was a data observatory dedicated to making COVID-19 data accessible and easy to understand for everyone. Our mission was to bridge the gap between complex data sets and the general population, ensuring that vital information was clear and actionable.

**Impact and Achievements 📊**

Over almost four years, PICOVID made a significant impact, especially in small Brazilian cities. Here are some highlights:

- **18 Municipalities Covered:** We partnered with 2 official municipalities to provide tailored data insights.
- **13 Media Shares:** Our work was featured in various articles, newspapers, podcasts, radio shows, and TV segments.
- **20K+ Unique Visitors:** Our website attracted over 20,000 unique visitors, all seeking reliable COVID-19 information.
- **135K Page Views:** With over 135,000 page views, our data tools were widely utilized.
- **4K Social Media Followers:** Our online presence grew, with 4,000 followers engaging with our updates and resources.

At one point, I even felt like a celebrity! 😂 But jokes aside, the best part was meeting and collaborating with amazing people who shared the same passion and dedication.

**Gratitude and Special Thanks 💖**

This project wouldn't have been possible without the hard work of everyone involved. A special shoutout to **Cantão** for co-founding this initiative with me and putting in the relentless effort to drive our mission forward. Also, heartfelt thanks to **Polina Kuperman** for her incredible support during the funding program application process.

**Looking Forward 🚀**

As PICOVID concluded its activities at the beginning of 2024, the legacy of making data accessible continues. It's been truly meaningful to see our project remembered and valued even today.

Let's support more programs like Hub For Good and inspire those with great ideas to apply! Together, we can drive positive change and build tools that benefit communities worldwide. 🌍✨

Congratulations to everyone who made this program a success, and here's to many more impactful projects in the future! 🎉
